## About this skill

Apply Anthropic's official brand colors and typography to any artifact with precision and consistency. Includes the complete Anthropic color system featuring main colors (dark #141413, light #faf9f5, mid gray, light gray) and signature accent colors (orange #d97757, blue #6a9bcc, green #788c5d). Uses professional font pairing with Poppins for headings and Lora for body text, with automatic fallbacks to Arial and Georgia. Smart application logic automatically selects appropriate colors based on background, applies fonts based on text size, and maintains visual hierarchy. Perfect for creating on-brand presentations, documents, and visual materials that align with Anthropic's design standards.
