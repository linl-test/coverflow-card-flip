## About this skill

Create stunning generative art using p5.js with sophisticated algorithmic philosophies. Design unique computational aesthetics through flow fields, particle systems, noise patterns, and parametric variations. Each artwork is seeded for reproducibility, ensuring identical output for the same parameters. Includes an interactive web viewer with real-time parameter controls, seed navigation for exploring variations, and export capabilities. Perfect for creating algorithmic posters, digital art installations, and computational design experiments that blend mathematical precision with artistic expression.
