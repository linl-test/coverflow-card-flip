## About this skill

Comprehensive web application testing toolkit using Playwright for automated browser interactions. Features decision tree for choosing testing approaches (static HTML vs dynamic webapps), server lifecycle management with with_server.py helper supporting multiple concurrent servers (backend + frontend), and reconnaissance-then-action pattern for dynamic apps. Navigate to pages, wait for JavaScript execution and network idle state, capture full-page screenshots, inspect rendered DOM, identify selectors from actual page state, and execute user interactions. View browser console logs for debugging, discover elements (buttons, links, inputs), and automate complex workflows. Includes example scripts for element discovery, static HTML testing, and console logging. Critical emphasis on proper wait states before DOM inspection to avoid testing incomplete page states. Essential for verifying frontend functionality, debugging UI behavior, and ensuring quality in modern web applications.
