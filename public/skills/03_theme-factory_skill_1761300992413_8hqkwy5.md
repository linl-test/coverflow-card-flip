## About this skill

Professional theme application toolkit for styling any artifact with curated color palettes and typography. Includes 10 pre-designed themes with complete specifications: Ocean Depths (calming maritime blues), Sunset Boulevard (warm vibrant sunset), Forest Canopy (natural earth tones), Modern Minimalist (clean contemporary grayscale), Golden Hour (rich autumnal), Arctic Frost (cool crisp winter), Desert Rose (soft sophisticated dusty tones), Tech Innovation (bold modern tech), Botanical Garden (fresh organic greens), and Midnight Galaxy (dramatic cosmic deep tones). Each theme provides cohesive color palette with hex codes, complementary font pairings for headers and body text, and distinct visual identity. Can also generate custom themes on-the-fly based on user requirements, automatically selecting appropriate colors and fonts. Ensures proper contrast, readability, and maintains consistent visual identity across slides, documents, and other artifacts.
