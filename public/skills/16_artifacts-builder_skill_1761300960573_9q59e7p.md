Perfect for creating complex web applications that require state management, client-side routing, or sophisticated UI components. The toolkit automatically initializes projects with proper configuration, allows rapid development with full TypeScript support and path aliases, then bundles everything into a single self-contained HTML file using Parcel. Ideal for building interactive dashboards, data visualization tools, admin panels, and rich web experiences that can be shared instantly through Claude artifacts.
