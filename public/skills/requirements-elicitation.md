## Description

Systematic framework for analyzing product documents (PRDs, feature specs, user stories, roadmaps, one-pagers) to identify gaps, generate clarifying questions for PMs and engineers, and assess technical risks. This skill should be used when engineers or technical leads need to bridge PM documents and implementation by eliciting missing technical details rather than making assumptions. Use when asked to extract technical requirements, review specs, identify what's missing, or prepare clarifying questions from product documents.
