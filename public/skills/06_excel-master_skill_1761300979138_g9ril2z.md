Build financial models with assumptions placement, error prevention strategies, and source documentation. Analyze data using pandas for complex data manipulation and visualization. Edit existing files while preserving formulas and formatting. Includes mandatory LibreOffice-based formula recalculation with detailed error reporting (#REF!, #DIV/0!, #VALUE!, #NAME?, #N/A detection). Features comprehensive formula verification checklist, best practices for both libraries, and specific guidelines for financial modeling conventions.
