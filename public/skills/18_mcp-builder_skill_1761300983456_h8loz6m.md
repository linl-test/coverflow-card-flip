## About this skill

Comprehensive guide for creating high-quality Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that enable LLMs to interact effectively with external services. Supports both Python (FastMCP) and TypeScript (MCP SDK) implementations. Follows agent-centric design principles: build workflow-focused tools (not just API wrappers), optimize for limited context windows, design actionable error messages, and use evaluation-driven development. Includes deep research phase covering MCP protocol documentation, framework-specific best practices, and exhaustive API study. Features systematic implementation guidance for shared utilities, input validation (Pydantic/Zod), response formatting (JSON/Markdown), and comprehensive error handling. Includes complete evaluation framework for creating 10 realistic test questions that verify LLM effectiveness. Essential for building production-quality MCP servers with proper tool design, documentation, and testing.
