## Description

React and Next.js performance optimization guidelines from Vercel Engineering. Use when writing, reviewing, or refactoring React/Next.js code to ensure optimal performance patterns. Triggers on tasks involving React components, Next.js pages, data fetching, bundle optimization, or performance improvements.

## When to use this skill

- Writing new React components or Next.js pages and need best-practice performance guidance.
- Reviewing or refactoring React/Next.js code for data fetching, rendering, or bundle-size optimizations.
- Optimizing load times or eliminating waterfalls in server/client data flows.

## Success signals

- Code applies the prioritized rules (waterfall elimination, bundle-size reductions, server/client fetch efficiency).
- Refactors reduce re-renders, improve load times, and avoid regressions across routes/pages.
- Resulting code is production-ready: consistent patterns, smaller bundles, and measurable performance improvements.
