## About this skill

Professional animated GIF toolkit optimized for Slack's strict requirements (64KB for emoji GIFs, 2MB for message GIFs). Features composable animation primitives including shake, bounce, spin, pulse, fade, zoom, explode, wiggle, slide, flip, morph, move (with arc/circle/wave paths), and kaleidoscope effects. Each primitive is designed to be combined freely for complex animations. Includes comprehensive validators for dimensions and file size, GIFBuilder for assembly with automatic color quantization and duplicate frame removal, and optimization strategies for aggressive size reduction. Supports text rendering with outlines, emoji integration, professional color palettes, particle systems, and visual effects. Features easing functions for smooth motion, frame composition utilities, and detailed examples for common patterns (reactions, actions with impact, multi-primitive combinations). Philosophy emphasizes creative freedom within technical constraints.
