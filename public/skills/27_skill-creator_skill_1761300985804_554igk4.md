## About this skill

Meta-skill for creating effective Claude skills from conception to distribution. Learn the complete skill development lifecycle: understanding usage patterns through concrete examples, planning reusable resources (scripts for deterministic code, references for documentation, assets for output files), initializing projects with proper structure, and implementing with progressive disclosure design (metadata → SKILL.md → bundled resources). Master the art of writing for AI consumption using imperative form and objective language. Utilize included init_skill.py for project scaffolding, package_skill.py for validation and ZIP creation, and follow iterative improvement workflows based on real-world testing. Understand when to extract code into scripts, when to provide reference documentation, and when to bundle assets. Essential for building maintainable, well-documented skills that extend Claude's capabilities effectively.
